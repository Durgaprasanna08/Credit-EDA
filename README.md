Credit Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project explores a dataset related to credit applications, aiming to understand patterns and insights using statistical and visual methods. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and key findings to inform decision-making processes in credit assessment.

Contents:

Dataset Overview: Description of the dataset including features, target variables, and sources.

Data Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Analysis: Statistical summaries, visualizations (such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices), and insights derived from the data.

Key Findings: Significant observations and trends discovered through the analysis that may impact credit assessment strategies.

Conclusion: Summary of the project's findings and their potential implications for stakeholders in credit evaluation and risk management.

Future Steps: Suggestions for further analysis, model development, or improvements in data collection to enhance credit assessment processes.

Tools Used: Python (libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
